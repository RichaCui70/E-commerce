# E-commerce
A Java program that emulates an online shopping experience. 
Users can create products; set markup rates, set tax rates, set a product name, and set a wholesale price per product. 
They can then add said product to a shopping cart where the cart will find products, tally prices, empty the cart, add products, and remove products.
